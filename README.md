# Getting Started with the Codebase API Demo ([CalHacks 8.0](https://calhacks.io) - Oct 2021)

## Workshop Guide

[Workshop Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ock4fahhesc0gq7y71b6d/APIs-and-Backend-Development-with-Node.js-and-MongoDB.paper?dl=0&rlkey=x8amajxmhy7jplk9wyvhnlg8i) (contains more in-depth examples!)

## Setup

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. In your terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/baileysegall/api-demo.git` **or** download the ZIP file (if you don't have git installed) by clicking on the green **Code** button on the top right of the repository and clicking on Download ZIP File.
3. Run `npm install` in the root project directory to install dependencies we need to run the code.

## Running the app

In the root project directory, run `npm start`. This may take a few seconds, after which a new tab will pop up in your browser with the URL `https://localhost:3000`. This is where the web app runs locally on your computer!

If you make changes to your code, make sure to save and then refresh the page for the changes to take effect.
